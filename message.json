Based on our previous conversations, you mentioned that your interest in becoming vegetarian began after visiting animal shelters and that this choice has remained with you since then. You've also shown enthusiasm for cooking restaurant-quality dishes like dal makhani and palak paneer from scratch. \n\nIf you're still unsure about your current diet status or need some guidance on how to identify it, I'd recommend checking what meals you typically consume in a day or week, paying attention to the ingredients used. Vegetarian diets exclude meat, poultry, fish, and sometimes eggs and dairy products. If you include any of these items in your regular meals, then you might be considering yourself non-vegetarian.\n\nWould you like some tips on how to maintain a balanced vegetarian diet or perhaps recommendations for restaurants that cater to vegetarians?"
